# Raising Issues

Before you submit an issue, please search to see if your issue has already been identified. It may be that there is a workaround available that will let you progress whilst the fix is being worked on.

Please raise a new issue using one of the provided [template form](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE). Please try to use the template as fully as possible; once completed it will provide us with all the information needed to reproduce, confirm and subsequently fix an identified issue. This is particularly important since certain issues may only manifest themselves on a specific operating system / browser combination.

Unfortunately, we are not able to investigate / fix bugs that are not documented sufficiently enough to be reproducible. We will contact you if we require more information, but if you do not respond we will close the issue.
